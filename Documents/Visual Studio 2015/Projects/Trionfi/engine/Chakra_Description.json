      "Description": "The Fool Tarot Card is a special card within the Major Arcana Tarot Cards. Its numerical value of 0 basically puts it wherever within the deck. Traditionally the card is placed in front of the Magician Tarot Card or between the Judgment Tarot Card, card XX and the World Tarot Card, card XIX. The Fool Tarot Card depicts a young man journeying through difficult terrain. He’s distant in his eyes and seems to be unaware of the environment. A dog is at his feet and the young man is carrying a bag at the end of a stick."
